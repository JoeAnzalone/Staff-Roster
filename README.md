Expo Staff Roster
=================
A list of people that work at Expo, and their social media accounts

Expo's staff roster is a static HTML site generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


Installation

All the data is stored in `_data/staff.json` so if you'd like to make changes and preview them locally, you'll need to [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and run the following command:

    jekyll serve -w
