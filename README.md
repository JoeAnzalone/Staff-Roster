Expo Staff Roster
=================
A list of people that work at Expo, and their social media accounts

Expo's staff roster is a static HTML site generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


Installation
------------
All the data is stored in `_data/staff.yml` in [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) format so if you'd like to make changes and preview them locally, you'll need to [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and run the following command:

    jekyll serve -w

Once you're happy with your changes, be sure to merge them to the `gh-pages` branch.
