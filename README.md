Expo Staff Roster
=================
A list of people that work at Expo, and their social media accounts

Expo's staff roster is a static HTML site generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


Installation
------------
All the data (team names, employee names, and social media accounts) is stored in [`_data/staff.json`](https://github.com/ExpoTV/Staff-Roster/blob/gh-pages/_data/staff.json) so most updates to this repo will occur in that file.
If you'd like to preview your changes locally, you'll need to [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and run the following command:

    jekyll serve -w

You can also edit this file directly in your browser using [GitHub's built-in editor.](https://github.com/ExpoTV/Staff-Roster/edit/gh-pages/_data/staff.json)

Profile photos are displayed using [Google+ badges](https://developers.google.com/+/web/badge/).
You can get people's Google+ ID's from their profile URL. If a person's URL is `https://plus.google.com/u/0/103523117099997170256/about` then their ID would be `103523117099997170256`.

If they have a vanity name, you can use that name as long as you prefix it with the plus sign.
If the URL is `https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JoeAnzaloneOfficial/about` you would use `+JoeAnzaloneOfficial` as the ID in staff.json.

The only required key for an employee object is "name" but it supports the following social networks:

* google
* website
* twitter
* instagram
* github
* facebook

For example:

    {
      "name": "Joe",
      "google": "+JoeAnzaloneOfficial",
      "website": "http://JoeAnzalone.com",
      "twitter": "HTMLbyJoe",
      "instagram": "PicsByJoe",
      "github": "JoeAnzalone"
    }
